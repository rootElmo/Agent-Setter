# Agent-Setter

Small script for configuring Xubuntu salt agents with personalized settings.

## Usage

If using something like Oracle VM VirtualBox for salt agents, remember to use Bridged Adapter in the Network settings!

To configure the machine, use the following:

	wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rootElmo/Agent-Setter/master/run.sh
	bash run.sh

## To-do

- Test that installed programs actually installed in run.sh
- Check to see if salt-minion service is running or not
